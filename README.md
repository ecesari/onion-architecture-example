# Onion Architecture Example

This project is a .NET application built using the Onion Architecture pattern. It leverages various modern software development practices and technologies to create a robust and maintainable solution.

## Introduction

This project is a .NET application that follows the principles of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**, and employs the **Onion Architecture pattern**. It is designed to provide a scalable and modular solution for your specific problem domain.

The project is written in **C#** with **.NET** and uses **Entity Framework Core** to manage the database. It embraces the **SOLID** principles to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Onion Architecture**: The project is structured following the Onion Architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns with distinct layers for the core application logic, application services, and infrastructure.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: DDD principles are applied to define and model the core domain entities, aggregates, and value objects, allowing for a clear representation of your business domain within the code.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: CQRS is implemented to separate the write (command) and read (query) sides of your application. This architecture enables efficient data retrieval and optimized command handling.

- **Entity Framework Core**: Entity Framework Core is used as the data access technology, providing a seamless and efficient way to interact with your database.

- **Specification Design Pattern**: The Specification pattern is employed to create reusable and composable query specifications, making it easier to express complex filtering criteria for your data.

- **xUnit Testing**: The project utilizes xUnit as the testing framework to ensure code quality and reliability.

- **MediatR**: MediatR is integrated to handle requests and commands, promoting loose coupling and improving the organization of your application's business logic.
